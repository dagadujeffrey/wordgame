WordGrid is a turn-based multiplayer word game that combines strategy, vocabulary, and mind games. Players take turns suggesting letters and strategically placing them on a shared 4×4 grid. The objective is to form valid English words horizontally or vertically—each up to 4 letters long—to earn points.
